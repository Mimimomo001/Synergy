# Synergy
This project categorizes stars, quasars, and galaxies using extracted features from astronomical data. It employs four machine learning algorithms: KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, comparing their performance to determine the most effective approach for classification.
